This product includes software developed by Computing Services at Carnegie Mellon 
University (http://www.cmu.edu/computing/).  Specifically is is directly derived
from existing SASL mechanism code from the CMU Cyrus SASL distibution.


To build this you need to have installed:

1)	Cyrus SASL
	http://www.cyrusimap.org/
	SASL library framework with plugin API.  Used in CMU IMAP server and others.

	License: http://www.cyrusimap.org/mediawiki/index.php/Downloads#Licensing

2)	OpenSSL
	This has to be well known....

3)	LibCURL
	http://curl.haxx.se
	"libcurl is a free and easy-to-use client-side URL transfer library, 
	supporting DICT, FILE, FTP, FTPS, GOPHER, HTTP, HTTPS, IMAP, IMAPS, LDAP, 
	LDAPS, POP3, POP3S, RTMP, RTSP, SCP, SFTP, SMTP, SMTPS, TELNET and TFTP. ..."

	License: http://curl.haxx.se/docs/copyright.html

4)	Jansson JSON library
	http://www.digip.org/jansson/
	Jansson is a C library for encoding, decoding and manipulating JSON data.

	Jansson is licensed under the MIT license. 

This initial build has many warts/blemishes/shortcuts.  It does not have autoconf 
working for example, and has the dependency directory stuff hard coded at the moment, 
which is gross.
